## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. DOM: Dom stands for Document Object Model. It's the programming interface that represents the webpages structure. (What you see)

2. Object-oriented programming: A programing concept based on objects that encapsulates data and behavior. Programs are organized into classes and objects, classes being the blueprint for objects, and objects being the instances for the classes. OOP is resuable, modular, and clearly structured.

3. Ruby: a dynamic interpreted object oriented language know for simplicity and productivity. Designed to be easy to read and write. Apparently it promotes devloper happiness and productivity. That's seems a bit far fetched, but perhaps it's true.
